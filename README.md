# Investment Management and Portfolio Optimization using R Programming

[](https://investresolve.com/file/jpg/portfolio-optimization.jpg)

The application is hosted on ShinyApps.io and can be found [HERE](https://gv9wj.shinyapps.io/Risk-Management-and-Portfolio-Optimization/)

Within this repository, I have included the source code for a Shiny Web Application which uses Perfomance Analytics and Quantmod to give a portfolio based on the 
stocks a person wishes to invest in. It minimizes the Risk and its standard deviation to give a portfolio optimized on return of investment. 


Packages used:
```
Shiny
quantmod
PerformanceAnalytics
tseries
ggplot
ggthemes
PortfolioAnalytics
ROI
```

This project has been developed after I watched a youtube series on portfolio optimization with R and also started reading the book "Technical Analysis with R" by Ko Chin Yu
