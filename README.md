Within this repository, I have included the source code for a Shiny Web Application that uses Perfomance Analytics and Quantmod to provide the user with an optimized portfolio based on the stocks given by the user.  The portfolio is optimized by reducing the standard deviation of risk, and increasing the return of investment, based on historical data.  
It provides the user with the following information based on the tickers submitted: 

1. Risk over the past 10 years
2. Optimized Weights for the portfolio
3. Correlation among the stocks in the portfolio
4. An Annualized table and visualization on the returns of each stock in the portfolio




Packages used:
```
Shiny
quantmod
PerformanceAnalytics
tseries
ggplot
ggthemes
PortfolioAnalytics
ROI
```

This project has been developed after I watched a youtube series on portfolio optimization with R and also started reading the book "Technical Analysis with R" by Ko Chin Yu
